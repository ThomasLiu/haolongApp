# haolongApp

This project combines the application skeleton for a typical [Angular](http://angularjs.org/) web 
app with [RequireJs](http://requirejs.org/) for modularized components. It also makes use of 
[Html5Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) for a nice starting point!

For a detailed explanation of the majority of the files in this project, checkout the original
[angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project.
